# Equine Integration Feedback Improvement - Advanced Media semester 

## Purpose of the project
With this project, we wanted to make the feedback equestrians get to see after measuring their trainings more understandable for them. Our solution: new Flutter in-app pages, a watch application and a widget extension for both iOS and Android. Everything we worked out is based on the designs we worked out in Figma.
